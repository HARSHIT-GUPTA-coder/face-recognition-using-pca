## Basic Matlab code to implement face recognition using PCA

This repository includes code that using PCA - Principal Component Analysis to do various tasks.

Includes:
1. Using PCA to find the relationship(linear) between two variables using sample datapoints
2. Using PCA as a classifier on the iris-dataset. 
3. A digit classifier for the mnist dataset
4. Using PCA for generating new representatives of a set. Set used are the fruit images.
5. And lastly, Face Recognition. The face recognition includes three different ways to use PCA.
